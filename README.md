## 2017 Web Week — Interactive Projects
Welcome to the repository for interactive projects for web week from Cherubs 2017! 

Each project has a folder in this repository. The projects are:

* [Campus Study Spots](campus-study-spots)
* [Cherubs Alumni Timeline](/cherub-alumni-timeline)
* [Cherub Quiz](/cherub-quiz)
* [Cherubs Around the World](/cherubs-around-the-world)
* [East Fairchild Map](/east-fairchild-map)
* [Interviews By The Numbers](/interviews-by-the-numbers)
* [Ping Pong Tournament](/ping-pong-tournament)

Open that folder here on GitHub and you should see additional instructions on how to edit the code you're working on and how to embed it in WordPress.

Happy Coding!
